## `EE/FPGA`
Every subfolder in this folder is a project.

Some projects may have dependencies of other projects.
For example, some project may have referenced a verilog file from other project. **Notice** that the ip file can not be referenced but **can only be copied** to other projects.

A `.cdf` file may have been added to the project, but will not be tracked by git. It is added to the project only for convenience.
