## TODO
- [ ] 3/5, font issue, align font width with div element width, add a button to change font size(optional).
- [ ] 3/6, work on `editor-cursor-line`, enable changing cursor with mouse, enable wrapping.

## some note
* 2020/03/04: I get stuck when I try to calculate the width of the text. Maybe I should learn some css at the same time.
